Get connected word v2
tf = count of the target word in a track/count of the word with max count in a track
idf = log2(total no. of tracks/count of track with the target word)

varing tf*idf metrics for the target word across tracks.

can work with agg func: mean, mode, median, max of the tf*idf metrics for the target word

Get connected word v3
tf = count of the target word in the dataset/count of the word with max count in the dataset
idf = log2(total no. of tracks/count of track with the target word)

single tf*idf metrics.
